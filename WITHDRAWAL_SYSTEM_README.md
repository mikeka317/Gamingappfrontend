### Real Stripe Connect Integration

#### 1. **Bank Account Onboarding**
```typescript
// Add new bank account
const addBankAccount = async () => {
  // Redirect to Stripe Connect onboarding
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/connect/onboarding', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ userId: currentUser.id })
  });
  
  const { url } = await response.json();
  window.location.href = url; // Redirect to Stripe
};
```

#### 2. **Fetch Connected Accounts**
```typescript
// Get user's connected bank accounts
const fetchBankAccounts = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/connect/accounts', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}` }
  });
  
  const accounts = await response.json();
  setBankAccounts(accounts);
};
```

#### 3. **Process Withdrawal**
```typescript
// Process withdrawal via Stripe Connect
const processWithdrawal = async (withdrawalData: WithdrawalData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/connect/withdraw', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      amount: withdrawalData.amount,
      bankAccountId: withdrawalData.bankAccountId,
      userId: currentUser.id
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  return result;
};
```
