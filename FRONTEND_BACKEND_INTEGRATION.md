# Frontend-Backend Integration Guide

## Overview
The frontend has been successfully integrated with the JavaScript backend for authentication and user management.

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Backend Integration
- **API Service** (`src/services/api.ts`): Handles all API communication with the backend
- **Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`): Manages user authentication state
- **Protected Routes** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`): Prevents unauthorized access to protected pages

### âœ… Updated Pages
- **Login Page**: Now uses real authentication with the backend
- **Register Page**: Creates real user accounts in the backend database
- **Profile Page**: Fetches and updates real user data from the backend
- **Navbar**: Implements proper logout functionality

### âœ… Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Protected routes for authenticated pages
- Real-time user profile updates
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Loading states for better UX

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5072/api
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Make sure your backend is running on `http://localhost:<PORT>` (or update the API URL accordingly).

### 3. Test the Integration

#### Registration Flow:
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill in the form with valid data
3. Select gaming platforms
4. Submit the form
5. You should be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

#### Login Flow:
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter your email and password
3. Submit the form
4. You should be logged in and redirected to the dashboard

#### Profile Management:
1. Navigate to `/profile`
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Update your information
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Changes should be saved to the backend

#### Protected Routes:
- Try accessing `/dashboard`, `/lobby`, `/challenges`, `/transactions`, or `/profile` without logging in
- You should be redirected to the login page
- After logging in, you'll be redirected back to the original page

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` - Refresh JWT token

### User Profile
- `GET /api/auth/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile

### Health Check
- `GET /health` - Backend health check

## Error Handling
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- User-friendly error messages are displayed via toast notifications
- Authentication errors automatically redirect to login page
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions

## Security Features
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token refresh
- Protected routes
- Input validation
- CORS protection

## Next Steps
The integration is complete and ready for use. You can now:
1. Test user registration and login
2. Update user profiles
3. Add additional API endpoints as needed
4. Implement additional features like challenges, transactions, etc.

All authentication is now fully functional with your JavaScript backend! ðŸŽ‰
